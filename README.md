# Breaking Barriers – A Voice-First Mentorship Platform for Rural Youth

## 🌱 Project Overview

**Breaking Barriers** is a voice-first mentorship platform designed to empower rural youth like Sameer, who face language, literacy, and connectivity challenges. This app bridges the digital divide by offering mentorship and learning through voice interfaces—removing the need for typing, fast internet, or high-end devices.

## 📖 Backstory

Sameer is a 17-year-old from a small village who dreams of becoming a coder. But like many others in rural India, he struggles with:
- English-dominated resources
- Lack of local mentors
- Poor internet connectivity
- Typing and literacy barriers

This project is built to support youth like him—making mentorship **accessible**, **inclusive**, and **inspiring**.
